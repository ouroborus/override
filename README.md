### AE2 op security override

This mod allows ops to insert random biometrics cards into security terminals.

Create a biometrics card with the needed ownership and security settings then right-click this card onto a security
terminal. The card will be inserted into the terminal. If there is already a card for that player in the terminal, the
card already in the terminal will also be retrieved.
